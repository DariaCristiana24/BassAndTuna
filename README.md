Bass & Tuna is an arcade style rhythm game intended to be played with a specific controller. The goal of the game is to catch as many fish as you can. In order to catch a fish you need to move the controller in the direction of the arrows or rotate the reel. The controller is meant to resemble a fishing rod and was self-made by two of my teammates for this project.

In order to play without a controller these are the following keys:
W - forward
S - backwards
A - left
D - right
R- spin
P - press on the reel
